This guide is for those who wants to create their own site, portfolio, blog or already has and is looking for how and where to host their website.

[Github](https://github.com) is a platform where companies and indie developers store and manage their codes, projects, and software. It is a popular collaboration tool and a hub for open source applications. So go ahead and create your account if you haven't yet.

## 1. Creating your repository

After logging in, [create a new repository](https://github.new/ "Create new repository").

![Create a new repository][step-1]

#### Important Notes:

- Repository name should be _username_.github.io where _username_ is your username
- Check _Initialize this repository with a README_

## <a name="2"></a> 2. Adding files

There are two ways to create / add files to your repo: Github GUI or via command line. In this section, we'll utilize the GUI. Alternatively, you can skip this section and go to [Adding files via command line](#adding-files-via-command-line).

Click **Add file** and select **Create new file** or Upload if you already have your own `index.html`

![Adding a new file][step-2]

### 2.1 Creating your front page

On file creation, name your file as `index.html` and add this as content:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Document</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello World</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```

`index.html` is where you add the contents of your home page.

Next, scroll down at the bottom and add a commit message. Commit messages should just be a short description of the changes you just made e.g. `added index.html`

#### Done!

Your site is now available in _username.github.io_

## <a name="adding-files-via-command-line"></a> 3. Adding files via command line using Git (Alternative)

If you've already added files via Github's GUI, you can skip this section and go to [Setting up custom domain](#4) section.

<div className="note">

Install [Git locally for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win) (preinstalled if you're using Mac)

</div>

### 3.1 Clone your repo locally

Open your favorite terminal app. For windows, you can use Windows Powershell or install the [new Windows Terminal](https://www.microsoft.com/en-hk/p/windows-terminal/9n0dx20hk701?activetab=pivot:overviewtab). Personally, I use [Hyper](https://hyper.is/) terminal.

Run the following command (replace username with your username).

```shell
git clone https://github.com/username/username.github.io.git
```

This will create a folder with the same name as your repository. The folder should only have `README.md` if you haven't add any files yet.

Change the terminal directory so you're inside that folder.

```shell
cd username.github.io
```

### 3.2 Creating and editing files

Go ahead and create and add all the files you want to add to your website. The only required file is `index.html` - this is where the contents of the home page of your site will go.

### 3.3 Adding / uploading files to repo

For now all your files are not yet officially in your repo.
Run the `git status` command.

```shell
git status
```

This will list all the files added or changed.

```shell
C:\Users\Bill Castillo\Documents\Github\billcasbie.github.io> git status
On branch master
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

        index.html
        styles/

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```

Add all files using:

```shell
git add .
```

You can also add individual files if you don't want to add all. Add files via `git add <file>` command.

```shell
git add index.html
git add styles/style.css
```

Verify files added via `git status`

```shell
C:\Users\Bill Castillo\Documents\Github\billcasbie.github.io> git status
On branch master
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)

        new file:   index.html
        new file:   styles/style.css
```

You can also remove files via `git reset <file>`

```shell
git reset .
git reset index.html
```

### 3.4 Commiting and pushing files

After adding files, next step is to commit it. Commit files via `git commit -m "<commit message>"`. Commit messages should just be a short description of your change.

```shell
git commit -m "added index and style"
```

This will create a hash code for that specific change. Each commit is like a record for the git versioning system to document your changes. This allows you to revert or review each commit but that is a topic for another article.

Push the code with `git push origin master`. Pushing is the actual _upload_ stuff. You can't upload without a commit and you can't commit without adding files.

```shell
git push origin master
```

#### Done! Your files should be uploaded to your repo

Visit _username.github.io_ to see your site.

To set up a custom domain, you have to own one or purchase it on a domain provider. Personally, I use [Namecheap](https://namecheap.com) to manage my domains. There are many providers out there, just make sure they are ICANN-accredited.

### 4.1 Creating CNAME record

- Go to your repository settings
- Scroll down to the `Github Pages` section
- In the _Custom domain_ area, enter your domain and click save.

This will generate a CNAME file in your repo.

### 4.2 Point your domain to Github

This is the part where we tell your custom domain to use Github as the platform to host your website.

Go to the dashboard of where you purchased your domain. There should be an option to modify its **Nameservers**. Then, select **Custom DNS**. Add the following IP Addresses:

- 192.30.252.153
- 192.30.252.154

![Custom DNS][custom-dns]

#### You're all setup!

Note that changes to DNS might take a few minutes to an hour to take effect.
Also, the domain _username.github.io_ will now redirect to your custom domain.

## 5. Setting up Cloudflare (Optional)

<div className="note">

Note that this is only for sites with custom domain.

</div>

[Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com) is a [content delivery network (CDN)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network) service that makes your site faster by storing and caching your site to the closest server based on your locationâ€”this saves bandwidth on the client side.

Another reason is that they equip your site with free SSL (https). Although you can also get certified with [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/getting-started/) for free, Cloudflare saves you time on setting up by just ticking one option in configurations. There's a lot of stuff behind the scenes but that's the gist of it. It is FREE but they have paid plans if you are interested in their services.
